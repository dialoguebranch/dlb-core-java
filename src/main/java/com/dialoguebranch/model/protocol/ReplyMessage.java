/**
 * This class is used for dialogue replies that are sent to the client in the
 * web service protocol. It mirrors the class {@link Reply}. The
 * differences are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The statement (if available) has been converted from a {@link NodeBody} to a {@link
 *   DialogueStatement} where variables have been resolved and set commands have been executed. The
 *   statement only contains text segments and input segments.</li>
 *
 *   <li>The commands in a {@link Reply} can be action commands or set commands. Since only action
 *   commands are relevant to the client, this class does not contain set commands. They will be
 *   handled on the server when the user selects the reply. Action commands have been converted to
 *   {@link DialogueAction DialogueAction}s where variables have been resolved.</li>
 *
 *   <li>This class does not have a node pointer, because that is not relevant for the client. It is
 *   handled by the server when the user selects this reply. Instead of that, this class indicates
 *   whether this reply ends the dialogue. This is set if the reply has a pointer to the end node.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
